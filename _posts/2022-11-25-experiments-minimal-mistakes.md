Yesterday I dedicated some time to investigate [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/). I would say that it well spent time - blog is running now on this theme.

In general theme works fine. The only problem which I had was a local building of the blog ;) I was facing following error:

```
Build Warning: Layout 'single' requested in _posts/2022-07-24-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown does not exist.
```

Not really helpful?

Under [this link](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/2071#issuecomment-769329832) I have found following recipe:

Add to `_config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
```

Add to `Gemfile`:

```conf
gem 'jekyll-remote-theme'
```

Execute:

```bash
bundle update
```

Now everything should work as expected:

```bash
âžœ  bluszcz.github.io git:(main) bundle exec jekyll serve

Right now I am investigating *Collections* and *Pages* to incorporate some sort of ***Portfolio*** page.
