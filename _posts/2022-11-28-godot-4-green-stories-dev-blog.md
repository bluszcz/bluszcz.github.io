I used to do hobbyists game development for some years, some of the projects can be found on the [Devcarpet](https://devcarpet.net) page, with my two favorites - [Deer Portal]() and [Deer Shifter]() - the second one have been developed for the Game Jam Ludum Dare.

I am also a gamer, and recently I have been playing a bit of Stardew Valley. It inspired me to come up with a new project. I have checked the current development status of Godot Engine - it seems that [beta 6 has been released](https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-6), and I have decided to use this one.

I have purchased also several tiles and sprite collections during the last decade - mostly on Humble Bumble sales. 

For the VCS I chose [Gogs](https://gogs.io/) hosted on my Raspberry Pi at home. It provides me Git functionality, simply Wiki and the Issues for the project. Perfect bare bone minimmum.

Right now I am reading about new features in Godot 4, but also reminded of how to work with TileMap and TileSets.

Winter is coming, let's see.
