This post is slightly delayed, but still worth mentioning. After a few months of my work on the jekyll-strapi plugin, I have become an official maintainer of this plugin, and my previous work has been merged into the main branch.

* [Jekyll Strapi 4 plugin](https://github.com/strapi-community/jekyll-strapi)

And the Gem can be found here:

* [Jekyll-Strapi-4 Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-strapi-4/)

I am also working on improving this blog. I was for a few moments considering switching to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), but Jekyll's integration with GitHub is very convincing. I have also found an excellent theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) to which I am upgrading now my blog.
