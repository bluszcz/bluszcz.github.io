I like the new Godot 4. Even though it is still beta (6th release), I think it works very stable. However, I have to say that I was working mostly with new unified Tilemaps and Tilesets.

![Progress](/assets/images/gamedev/gs03.jpg)

After a few hours of work and a mix of reminding how things work in Godot 3 and the changes incoming with Godot 4 - I have managed to create a simple animation of the character and a tiled map which I will use for the game.

As you can see from the screenshot - it will be a top-down 2D game, a mix of an adventure game, role play and a bit of survival/farming game. Think like point-and-click mixed with tower defense and dungeons and dragons. And the mystery, a secret story being discovered step by step.
