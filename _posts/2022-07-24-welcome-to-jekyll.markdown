I am happy to announce my new website. It is using Jekyll with my new Bootstrap 5 based theme. I set it up to learn more about Jekyll, which is related to my recent Open Source activity - developing Jekyll plugin for the headless CMS Strapi 4. Some links below:

* [Jekyll Strapi 4 plugin](https://github.com/bluszcz/jekyll-strapi)
* [Devcarpet 01 BootStrap 5 Jekyll Template](https://github.com/bluszcz/jekyll-theme-devcarpet-01)

I've written recently a small tutorial how to use the plugin and you can find it here: https://medium.com/@bluszcz/static-site-generator-with-strapi-4-and-jekyll-4c5404cc9715
